I am a political scientist and I work as a Lecturer in Politics at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/">University College, Oxford</a>. I am completing a DPhil (PhD) at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/">Nuffield College</a> and the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/">Department of Politics and International Relations (DPIR)</a> at the <a class="highlight" href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. Previously, I studied at the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/">University of Essex</a> and the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.sc-politiche.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html">University of Florence</a>.

My research focuses on political representation and party competition, and on the role of social divisions and structure in politics. I have been studying changes in the policy platforms and ideological programs of political parties, social cleavages, party brands, and partisan alignments of political parties and voters.

I look at advanced industrial and post-industrial democracies, with particular focus on Western Europe, and I primarily use quantitative methods.

I am also interested more broadly in questions on electoral politics and voting behaviour, electoral systems and electoral reform, democracy and state formation.
